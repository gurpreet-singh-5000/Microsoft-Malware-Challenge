# Microsoft-Malware-Challenge
Machine Learning Project to classify computers as Defected or Safe. Full dataset is available on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com). I used a small chunk of the dataset to compare the performances of LR, SVM and GNB after performing one-hot encoding and then applying PCA. 
Results and details of the task are available.
